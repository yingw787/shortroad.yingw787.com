### Why value investing?

Math and common sense.

Take two stocks, one that grows at 5% annually, and one that tanks 50% in the first year and proceeds to grow 10% annually. The latter stock will take **16 years** to overtake the former stock in price. That analysis does not take into account the accumulated gray hair or any additional downturn. That is the cost of loss.

On the other hand, if you purchased shares of a Dow Jones index fund via a dollar cost averaging scheme on the market's peak day before the Great Depression, you would have doubled your money by 1936.

You should also consider the certainty of long-term inflation that is constantly eating away at your savings account. You should very seriously consider value investing as a low-risk avenue to keep some of your assets from depreciating.

### How is this different from a service like Acorns?

We will **NEVER** ask to control any of your banking and investing accounts. We will **ALWAYS** leave the final judgment call to you, as we believe your money is ultimately your responsibility.

### How is this different from a service like Betterment?

We do not target 401Ks, IRAs, rollover accounts, or the like. We look at the financial statements of public companies indexed within the United States.

### How is this different from Robinhood?

We do not provide facilities to trade on our platform, and we hope we never will. We seek to optimize the quality of advice we give you when you seek recommendations from us.

### Why should I trust you guys?

Because we want to use this service that we're building out, and we intend on providing the same level of service to you as we would provide ourselves.

### What are you looking to charge for this service?

Something akin to **$10 per month**, though we may offer additional plans if there is significant demand. If you are interested in signing up and paying for this service, please let us know what price you believe is fair and justified.
